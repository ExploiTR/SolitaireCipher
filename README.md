## Work :
Nothing but showing a implementation of Bruce Schneier's Solitaire cipher.

## Permission Description

`SEND_SMS` : You know that.  
`READ_PHONE_STATE` : Provide you option to choose SIM slot in order to send messages [Android 5.0++]  
`READ_SMS` && `RECEIVE_SMS` : Check if sent SMS is *really* sent & provide a toast notification

## Why not the officially provided Java codes?

I don't understand cards except the main alogrithm by Schneier. Can't push code into my repo which I don't understand.
